## MyAnimelist.com Fansub data organizer

Organizes fansub data for anime that has since been removed by myanimelist.net ([Original page](https://myanimelist.net/fansub-groups.php?letter= )).

Website data courtesy of Reddit User [u/Fireraga](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fireraga) and [u/iBzOtaku](https://www.reddit.com/user/iBzOtaku) who scraped & organized the data before the site went down on this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9iq8yu/myanimelist_fansubs_archive/).

The output is a big `.txt` file organized as :
```
-----
<Show name>
<Group1> (Language) - <Rating>
<Group2> (Language) - <Rating>
...
```
Free to fork and modify code as needed.
