                    "An honest fansub of this show. Not the greatest though. Translations are fine, but video quality eats dick, and some lines are left out and untranslated. Not too big of a deal, but gets annoying sometimes.",
                    "The timing is quite bad, they often skip dialogue lines and it looks as it was done by someone who didn't even know how to speak english correctly.",
                    "-Didn't translate some lines\n-Weird timing on the subs\n-Quite a few typos\n-Intro vid is a little long if you're too lazy to skip it"
