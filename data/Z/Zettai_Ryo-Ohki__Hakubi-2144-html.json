                    "They do work on MPC. The person who disapproved is a retard who blames someone else when it's their fault.",
                    "they care alot about what they sub",
                    "It was easy to read and it wasnt invasive into the anime",

                    "Wasurenai subs are easy to interpret but have a few wording errors every episode. Hakubi on the other hand is nearly flawless, so that's that."
